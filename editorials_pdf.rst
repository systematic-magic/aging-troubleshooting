We suggest you use the :ref:`following procedure<correct_case_check>` if you are in doubt regarding this or that term.

2.5. Check Latin terms: 

	- The following Latin terms should be formatted in italics: *ex vivo, in silico, in situ, in vitro, in vivo*.

	- et al, etc, and via should be formatted in :ref:`plain text<plain_text>`.

.. _author_list_pdf_editorials:

3. Author List
--------------

.. Note::
	
	The number of authors is limited to three for editorials. |br|


3.1. Check that author list contains full names of authors divided by comma (,). If there are only 2 authors, then check that they are divided by "and" word.

3.2. Check that author names are written in black and bold font. 

3.3. Check that author’s name does NOT contain titles and/or degrees (e.g. Dr., Ph.D., M.D., etc.).

3.4. Check that there is no punctuation mark at the end of author list.

.. image:: /_static/editorial_authors.png
   :alt: Editorials Author format
   :scale: 99%

3.5. Check the format of the author name. 

Allowed formats:

	+  :sample:`FirstName LastName`
	+  :sample:`FirstName MiddleName LastName`
	+  :sample:`FirstName MiddleName MiddleName LastName` (there can any number of middle names)
	+  :sample:`FirstName M. LastName` (M. is initial of middle name; up to 4 letters; period should be used after each initial)
	+  :sample:`FirstName M.N. LastName` (M.N. are initials of middle names; up to 4 letters; period should be used after each initial)
	+  :sample:`F. MiddleName LastName` (F. is an initial of first name)
	+  :sample:`F. MiddleName MiddleName LastName` (F. is initial of first name and there can any number of middle names)

.. Important::
	As a general rule, we don't want to keep initials for first names. Request the expanded name from the author in this situation. If the authors insist on a first initial, then the middle name(s) must be present and fully expanded. |br| |br|
	LastName **cannot** be presented as initial (even if authors insist on this). LastName should always be presented in full.


Please note that last names can be compound, can have prepositions, suffixes, prefixes or be :ref:`mononyms<mononym>`. For example:

	- Compound last names: :sample:`Garcia-Closas, Gomez Jimenez`
	- Last name related prepositions: :sample:`Van den Brandt, van der Ent`
	- Suffixes: :sample:`Williams 3rd, Rowland Jr`
	- Prefixes: :sample:`McCann, O'Kelly`
	- Mononym: :sample:`Govindjee`

If you see that author name does not comply to these standards or you have a doubt about a name, please contact corresponding author and ask to provide author name in correct format.
(`PubMed <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/>`_ can be used as a resource to clarify doubts about author names, but this method should only be used if the author's name can be found to appear in one consistent way. Still check with author before making changes other than adding periods after initials.)

3.6. Check that author names do not have affiliation numbers.

3.7. Check that there are no affiliations listed for authors (there must be no affiliations on the page).


|

.. _text_pdf_editorials:

4. Text
-------

4.1. Check that font type and size is consistent throughout the body of the article.

4.2. Check all website addresses in article text:

	- Check that all website addresses are hyperlinked in blue color and underlined font.

	- Check that all website addresses have "http://" or "https://" present.

	- Check that all website addresses lead to valid page.

Check with author about nonworking links (see exceptions :ref:`here<links>`). They can choose to replace or remove them.
If an author requests to remove a link, then the name of the resource (software, database, tool, etc.) should be/remain present. In cases where the name of the resource is the same as the website URL (ex: MicroRNA.org), the protocol (https:// or http://), “www.” and any other excess information should be removed from the URL, and the remaining resource/website name should no longer be kept as an active link (ex: “http://www.microrna.org/microrna/home.do” would be changed to “MicroRNA.org”).

4.3. Check Latin terms (this applies to all text except References): 

	- The following Latin terms should be formatted in italics: *ex vivo, in silico, in situ, in vitro, in vivo*.

	- et al, etc, and via should be formatted in :ref:`plain text<plain_text>`.

	- :ref:`Plain text<plain_text>` is acceptable for all other Latin terms not noted above.

	- A period should follow "et al": et al.

4.4. British and American English spelling are both acceptable; however, consistency should be maintained.

.. _figures_pdf_editorials:

5. Figure
----------

.. Note::
	
	Only one figure should be used for editorials. |br|

5.1. Check that figure image has text and graphics which are clear and large enough to read.

If image is hard to read, please contact Production team and ask to provide clearer images. If Production team does not have better images, then contact corresponding author.

5.2. Check whether figures have :ref:`panel letters<figure_pannel>`. 

	  - A panel letter is not required in the case where there is only one image, or panel.
	  - Both lowercase and uppercase panel letters are allowed; however, they should be used consistently in the figure.

	  - Lowercase and uppercase subpanel letters as well as numbers are allowed; however, they should be used consistently in the figure. (Ex. Aa, Ba... **OR** AA, BA... **OR** A1, B1). Subpanels are not mandatory.


5.3. Check the figure description text (figure legend):

	- Check that figure legend has a figure number:

	  |	:sampleb:`Figure N.` (where “N” is a number of the figure)

	  - Check that number is followed by period (.).
	  - Check that figure number is formatted in bold and colored in black.

	  |
	  
	- If figure number is followed by text, then check that the first sentence of that text is formatted in bold and colored in black. The rest of the text should be in :ref:`plain text<plain_text>`.

	  |	:sampleb:`Figure 1. First sentence of legend text in sentence case.` :sample:`Second sentence and rest of text.`
	
	  .. image:: /_static/html_figure_number.png
   	     :alt: Figure number
   	     :scale: 99%

	  `Exclusion:` if first sentence contains :ref:`panel letters<figure_pannel>`, then it should be formatted in :ref:`plain text<plain_text>`.

	  |	:sampleb:`Figure 1.` :sample:`First sentence of legend text containing panel letter (`:sampleb:`A`:sample:`) and letter (`:sampleb:`B`:sample:`) in a sentence case. Second sentence and rest of text.`

	  .. image:: /_static/html_figure_number_exception.png
   	     :alt: Figure number
   	     :scale: 99%

	- If figure image has :ref:`panel letters<figure_pannel>`, then check that reference to each panel is present in figure legend. Reference is denoted by panel letter and is formatted in bold. Subpanels are allowed (Ex. Aa, Ab, Ac, etc.) but do not require individual callouts in the legend or text.

	  | If a reference to :ref:`panel letter<figure_pannel>` is missing, then please ask author to provide one.

	  - Check that every panel letter callout is formatted in bold font.
	  - Check that at least the first instance of each panel letter is enclosed in parentheses. Subsequent callouts of the same panel letter can be enclosed in parentheses, but this is not mandatory.	   
	  - Check that the case of each panel letter callout matches case of the panel letter used in the image. Uppercase or lowercase is fine as long as only one case is consistently used in the figure.
	  - Check that the first instance of each panel letter is called out in alphabetical order (Ex. A, B, A, C, B, D).
	  - :ref:`Panel letters<figure_pannel>` can be combined in different ways in the figure legend text (The same variations are allowed for lowercase :ref:`panel letters<figure_pannel>`):

	   |
	   
	   | :sample:`(`:sampleb:`A` :sample:`and` :sampleb:`B`:sample:`)`

	- Check the format of figure callouts (no other variations allowed):

	  | :sample:`Figure 1`

	  .. image:: /_static/pdf_figure_callouts.png
   	     :alt: Figure callouts
   	     :scale: 99%

	  |
	  
	  - If figure has panels, then callout can have a letter (letter case should be the same as on figure image):

	   |
	   
	   | :sample:`Figure 1A`
	   | :sample:`Figure 1a`

	   .. image:: /_static/pdf_fig_callout_full_letters.png

	   | `Examples of callout combinations:`
	   | :sample:`Figure 1`
	   | :sample:`Figure 1C`
	   | :sample:`Figure 1B` :sample:`and` :sample:`1C` (note that there is no "s" at the end of "Figure" word)
	   | :sample:`Figure 1B`:sample:`,` :sample:`1C`
	   | :sample:`Figure 1E`:sample:`–`:sample:`1G`

	   .. image:: /_static/pdf_fig_callout_variations.png
   	      :alt: Figure number
   	      :scale: 99%

	   |
	   
	  - Check that the word "Figure" as well as number (and letter) are hyperlinked.

	   |
	   
	- Check that each figure has at least 1 callout in the text.

	 | If callout is missing, please contact author.

	- Check that there is a space after comma (,) and no space before and after en dash (–).

	- Check that reference callouts are in :ref:`plain text<plain_text>` and not hyperlinked.

7.2. Check that callout number for each of the references is present in the text or is covered in the range of numbers. i.e. in the range of [1–3] reference 2 is not present in the text, but covered in the range. This case is acceptable. |br|
Callouts can be found in text and figures.

7.3. Check that there are no callouts for non-existing references (i.e. there is a callout, but there is no reference).

7.4. Check that there are no references for which callouts are missing (i.e. there is a reference, but there is no callout for it).

7.5. Check that reference callouts appear in linear order throughout the manuscript. 1, 2, 3 and so on. Once a reference has initially been called out, it can be called out again in any order. For example, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4 is OK.

	If one or more references or callouts are missing or are being called out of linear order in the text, please contact author.

If you find duplicate references, please contact author and ask to correct the reference list along with renumbering reference call-outs.

8.5.2. Check for references containing journal title in English and original language (e.g. "International journal of cancer" and "Journal international du cancer"). Remove title in original language and leave English version. If there is just a "foreign language" version present, it is OK to leave that version (no need to find English one). Consult `PubMed <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/>`_ if in doubt of the correct journal name.

8.5.3. Check for extra information in the references (i.e. in addition to "standard" information). Remove all extra information.
   
   | `Example:`
   | ":official publication of the society of…"


8.5.4. Remove any instances of "Available from", “[Internet]”, "[pii]" accessed dates (ex: “Accessed November 6, 2017.”) and empty (blank) doi.

8.5.5. Remove “PMCID” details, if present in any reference.

8.5.6. Check formatting for references that have been cited from supplemental issues. This information should appear in between the publishing year and semicolon in this format:

   | :sampleb:`(Suppl N)` (where “N” is the supplemental issue number)

	.. image:: /_static/suppl_issue_formatting.png
