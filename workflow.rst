Workflow
========

.. Note::
	
	VIP, Priority and COVID papers should be prioritized.


Basic Workflow
--------------
#. Check for errors that are detailed in our standards document.
#. Resolve any questions by inquiring with authors or internally.
#. Send all corrections for each paper in one email to the appropriate vendor and production editor. (Stop here for expedited papers.)
#. Verify that all corrections have been made once notified that they are complete. (Repeat steps 3–4 if there are still some pending corrections or new errors.)
#. Approve paper for archiving.


Details on Sending Corrections
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Each correction email should be sent to one of our vendors (Envisage or Aura) and one of our production editors (Olga or Elena). Olga manages Envisage’s papers and Elena manages Aura’s. One of the pair should be addressed and the other copied depending on the situation:

**Normal Papers**

Normal papers go through the complete checking and approving process (Steps 1–5).

	- Address to vendor and copy production editor.
	- Add "Priority" to email title for Priority and COVID papers.
	- Add "No Corrections Necessary" to the email title for papers that do not need corrections.

**Expedited Papers**

VIP papers and papers with minor corrections will be expedited to publication by Olga and Elena after we send them the corrections email (Steps 1–3); we do not approve these papers.

	- Address to production editor and copy vendor.
	- Add "VIP" to email title for VIP papers.
	- Add "Minor corrections" to email title and replace vendor's email with appropriate production editor's email on the Aging Production Sheet for papers that have 5 or less corrections anywhere in paper except Supplementary Materials.
