PDF: All Papers (except Editorials)
============================================

.. ATTENTION::
   	PDF checks are the same as HTML checks with some exceptions. This page explains the cases where PDF requirements **differ** from HTML checks.
   	Please use a merge of HTML and PDF checks for PDF review. Aside from noted differences below, all elements of the HTML should match the PDF.

.. _correspondence_pdf_research_papers:

6. Correspondence
-----------------

6.1. Check that correspondence section has a title “Correspondence to:” (:ref:`sentence case<sentence_case>` and followed by colon (:)).

6.2. Check that "Correspondence to:" is in black and bold font.

6.3. Check that "Correspondence to:" is followed by full author name. If there are a few corresponding authors, then all corresponding author full names should be listed after "Correspondence to:" and divided by comma (,).

6.5. Check that the word "email:" follows the corresponding author (author list). 

6.6. Check that the word “email:" is lowercase, is in black and bold font and ends with a colon (:).

6.7. Check that corresponding author email (or emails if there are a few of corresponding authors) are listed after “email:”. In the case of multiple corresponding authors, punctuation is determined whether or not an ORICD iD is present:

	- **Only emails are present:** check that each author’s email is separated by a comma (,)
	- **ORCID is present:** check that semicolons are used to distinguish each author’s email or email+ORCID pair, and a comma is used to separate an author’s email from their ORCID iD.

6.8. Check that there is no punctuation mark at the end of the last email.

.. _section_headers_pdf_research_papers:

11. Section Headers
-------------------

.. Note::
	
	Formatting checks for non-standard headings (including all types of subheaders) for Reviews and Research Perspectives should be skipped until further notice. Still check for spelling and grammatical errors.

11.1. All main section headers should be formatted in ALL CAPS, blue and bold font. A few examples below:

.. image:: /_static/pdf_section_headers.png

   :alt: PDF Section headers format

- Abbreviations and Editorial note sections are exceptions. They should be formatted in :ref:`sentence case<sentence_case>` and in blue and bold font.

   :alt: PDF header exceptions


- Free-style main sections in Reviews and Research Perspectives are an exception. These should be formatted in :ref:`sentence case<sentence_case>` and blue font.


11.2. Check the spacing of all headers in the article:

.. image:: /_static/pdf_figure_callouts.png
   :alt: Figure callouts
   :scale: 99%

13.2. Check placement of figures in the text:

- Figures should be positioned at the bottom of the page when not occupying a full page in PDF.

    - In rare instances a figure legend may extend to the top of the following page due to spatial limitations. This is OK, but please check with production to make sure the legend cannot be made to fit on the same page as the figure.

- Each figure should be placed after its first callout except when it’s not possible due to limitations of what can fit on one page and the size of figures and tables that are called out around each other.

.. _tables_pdf_research_papers:

14. Tables
----------
14.1. Check that callouts are formatted in :ref:`plain text<plain_text>` and are not hyperlinked.

14.2. Check placement of tables in the text:

	- Tables should be positioned at the top of the page when not occupying a full page in PDF.
	- Each table should be placed after its first callout except when it’s not possible due to limitations of what can fit on one page and the size of figures and tables that are called out around each other.


14.3. Check that table notes are presented in :ref:`justified<justified_text>`, :ref:`plain text<plain_text>`.

	- Please note that a single line of text as well as the last line of a justified paragraph will technically be :ref:`flush left<flushleft_text>`.
	- Authors are allowed to distribute table notes across separate lines, and there is no need to join these into a single justified paragraph unless there is apparent evidence that it has been formatted this way by error.

.. _pdf_supplementary_research_papers:

17. Supplementary Materials
---------------------------

.. Note::
	
	Supplementary materials are located in two places:

	1. HTML page  (after Materials and Methods section) - All supplementary materials are available here as separate downloads.

	2. PDF of the main manuscript (after References) - All supplementary materials that can be placed in a PDF are available here. Any materials that cannot fit in PDF due to formatting or size will have :ref:`callouts<pdf_supplementary_research_papers_text>` to the HTML where they can be downloaded and viewed. 

	This check is for the supplementary materials in the PDF. Checks for supplementary materials downloads in the HTML can be found :ref:`here<supplementary_html_research_papers>`.


.. Important::
	An average of about 10 pages is the combined total limit for tables and figures to occupy in the PDF. Excessive amounts of either or both should be removed from the PDF and callouts to HTML added in their place. The figures and tables can be seen as two separate units when determining what to remove. Remove all of either or both depending on how many pages each unit is taking up.

Supplementary materials should be located after the references of the main MS in the PDF.
