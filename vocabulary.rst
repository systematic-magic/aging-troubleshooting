.. _sentence_case:

Sentence case
    Sentence case is the conventional way of using capital letters in a sentence. That is, you only capitalize the first letter of the first word – like you would in a sentence. Proper nouns (including abbreviations, gene names, journal titles, scientific databases, etc.) have initial capitals as well.

    | `Examples:`
    | :sample:`The cat sat on the mat.`
    | :sample:`London is a capital of The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.`
    |

.. _title_case:

Title case
    Title case is the conventional way of using capital letters in a sentence. That is, you capitalize all principal words. Articles, conjunctions, and prepositions do not get capital letters unless they start the title.

    | `Examples:`
    | :sample:`Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.`
    | :sample:`Seven Habits of Effective People.`
    |
