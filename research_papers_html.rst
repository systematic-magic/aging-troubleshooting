HTML: All Papers (except Editorials)
====================================

.. _paper_type_html_research_papers:

1. Paper Type
-------------

1.1. Check that paper type matches JPS.

.. image:: /_static/html_paper_type.png
   :alt: Paper type
   :scale: 99%

|
.. _title_html_research_papers:

2. Title
--------

2.1. Check that title is in :ref:`sentence case<sentence_case>`.

2.2. Check title spelling.

2.3. Check that title is written in black and bold font.

2.4. Check that capitalization of scientific terms is correct.
We suggest you use the :ref:`following procedure<correct_case_check>` if you are in doubt regarding this or that term.

2.5. Check Latin terms: 

	- The following Latin terms should be formatted in italics: *ex vivo, in silico, in situ, in vitro, in vivo*.

	- et al, etc, and via should be formatted in :ref:`plain text<plain_text>`.

	- :ref:`Plain text<plain_text>` is acceptable for all other Latin terms not noted above.

2.6. Check that species and gene names are written in italics.

.. _author_list_html_research_papers:

3. Author List
--------------

3.1. Check that all author names in author list are separated by commas (,). No other separators allowed.

3.2. Check that author’s name does NOT contain titles and/or degrees (e.g. Dr., Ph.D., M.D., etc.).

3.3. Check that there is no period (or any other punctuation mark) after the last author name.

.. image:: /_static/html_author_list_separ.png
   :alt: Author list separators
   :scale: 99%


3.4. Check the format of the author name. 

Allowed formats:

	+  :sample:`FirstName LastName`
	+  :sample:`FirstName MiddleName LastName`
	+  :sample:`FirstName MiddleName MiddleName LastName` (there can any number of middle names)
	+  :sample:`FirstName M. LastName` (M. is initial of middle name; up to 4 letters; period should be used after each initial)
	+  :sample:`FirstName M.N. LastName` (M.N. are initials of middle names; up to 4 letters; period should be used after each initial)
	+  :sample:`F. MiddleName LastName` (F. is an initial of first name)
	+  :sample:`F. MiddleName MiddleName LastName` (F. is initial of first name and there can any number of middle names)

.. Important::
	As a general rule, we don't want to keep initials for first names. Request the expanded name from the author in this situation. If the authors insist on a first initial, then the middle name(s) must be present and fully expanded. |br| |br|
	LastName **cannot** be presented as initial (even if authors insist on this). LastName should always be presented in full.


Please note that last names can be compound, can have prepositions, suffixes, prefixes or be :ref:`mononyms<mononym>`. For example:

	- Compound last names: :sample:`Garcia-Closas, Gomez Jimenez`
	- Last name related prepositions: :sample:`Van den Brandt, van der Ent`
	- Suffixes: :sample:`Williams 3rd, Rowland Jr`
	- Prefixes: :sample:`McCann, O'Kelly`
	- Mononym: :sample:`Govindjee`

If you see that author name does not comply to these standards or you have a doubt about a name, please contact corresponding author and ask to provide author name in correct format.
(`PubMed <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/>`_ can be used as a resource to clarify doubts about author names, but this method should only be used if the author's name can be found to appear in one consistent way. Still check with author before making changes other than adding periods after initials.)

3.5. Check that each author name contains a number linked to the affiliation text (i.e. affiliation number). One author name can contain a few affiliation numbers.

.. image:: /_static/html_aff_texts_and_authors.png
	:alt: Affiliation texts and authors
	:scale: 99%


If there is only one affiliation text for all authors, then each author name should have "1" next to it. 

.. image:: /_static/html_one_affiliation_all_auth.png
   :alt: One affiliation for all authors
   :scale: 99%

3.6. Check that all affiliation numbers of the author list are separated by commas (,). No other separator is allowed.

4. Affiliations
---------------

.. Note::
	
	Contact author for guidance when unsure about a potential correction or in the case of any major changes such as suspected combined/duplicate affiliations, removal of street addresses and renumbering. It’s not necessary to contact author for minor spelling or punctuation errors or ones that can undoubtedly be verified such as the addition of a missing city or zip code.


4.1. Check spelling of English words only.

4.2. Check that there are NO street addresses and house numbers included in affiliation.

4.3. Check that country and city names are present in affiliation. State is also required and should be :ref:`abbreviated<state_abbr>` in U.S. affiliations.

	- Check that it has a separate affiliation number. One address - one affiliation number.

	- Check that the title (Current address: or Present address:) is in :ref:`sentence case<sentence_case>` and followed by colon (:). No other variations allowed.
	
All acceptable combinations of “Current/Present address” are depicted on the screenshot below:

	- If figure image has :ref:`panel letters<figure_pannel>`, then check that reference to each panel is present in figure legend. Reference is denoted by panel letter and is formatted in bold. Subpanels are allowed (Ex. Aa, Ab, Ac, etc.) but do not require individual callouts in the legend or text.

	  | If a reference to :ref:`panel letter<figure_pannel>` is missing, then please ask author to provide one.

	  - Check that every panel letter callout is formatted in bold font.
	  - Check that at least the first instance of each panel letter is enclosed in parentheses. Subsequent callouts of the same panel letter can be enclosed in parentheses, but this is not mandatory.
	  - Check that the case of each panel letter callout matches case of the panel letter used in the image. Uppercase or lowercase is fine as long as only one case is consistently used in the figure and throughout the paper. 
	  - Check that the first instance of each panel letter is called out in alphabetical order (Ex. A, B, A, C, B, D).
	  - :ref:`Panel letters<figure_pannel>` can be combined in different ways in the figure legend text (The same variations are allowed for lowercase :ref:`panel letters<figure_pannel>`):

13.4. Check that figure numbers are assigned to figures linearly (1, 2, 3 and so on) as well as continuously and there are no gaps in a sequence. In other words there should be no situation when there are figures 1, 3 and 4 in the article, but figure 2 is missing.

At the same time, upon authors request, figures can appear in the text in any order. E.g. figure 2 before figure 1 is OK as long as they are renumbered to appear linearly throughout the text.

If you see that there are gaps in number sequence, then check with corresponding author whether some figures are missing or whether it is possible to renumber the figures to eliminate the gaps.

14. Tables
----------

.. Note::
	
	Acceptable file format when requesting an updated table from author is Word doc.


14.1.  Check that table font size is large enough to read.

If table is hard to read, please contact Production team and ask to increase font size.

.. _table_title_check:

14.2. Check table title:

	- Check that there is a title above the table.

	- Check that title has table number:

	| :sampleb:`Table N.` (where “N” is a number of the table)

	In rare cases table number can contain a letter:

	| :sampleb:`Table 1A.` (where Table 1A and 1B, 1C etc are separate tables)

	- Check that table number is labeled as “Table” and followed by the table number. No substitutes such as “Chart” allowed in place of the word “Table”. Contact author before making this change while suggesting that we can indicate this detail in the table title if they prefer (Ex: Table 1. Chart showing...).

	- Check that number is followed by period (.).

	- Check that table number is followed by table title. Table title should be a single sentence. It is not allowed to have more than 1 sentence as a table title.

	| :sampleb:`Table 2. Table title in sentence case.`

	:alt: Table notes
	:scale: 99%

14.4. Check that table font, title font and notes (additional information) fonts are used consistently within the article (i.e. font should not vary from table to table).

14.5. Check table numbers. Tables should be numbered linearly (1, 2, 3 and so on) as well as continuously, so there are no gaps in the sequence. In other words, there should be no situation when there are tables 1, 3 and 4 in the article, but table 2 is missing.

At the same time, upon authors request, tables can appear in the text in any order. E.g. table 2 before table 1 is OK as long as they are renumbered to appear linearly throughout the text.

If you see that there are gaps in number sequence, then check with corresponding author whether some tables are missing or whether it is possible to renumber the tables to eliminate the gaps.

.. _tables_callouts_html_research_papers:

14.6. Check table callouts in the text:

	- Check the format of table callouts:

	| :sampleu:`Table 1` (or in rare cases :sampleu:`Table 1A`)
	|
	| `Examples:`
	| :sampleu:`Table 1`
	| :sampleu:`Table 2A`
	| :sampleu:`Tables 1` :sample:`and` :sampleu:`2` (note that there is an "s" at the end of "Table" word)

15. Reference Callouts
----------------------

15.1. Check reference callouts in the text:

	- Check the format of reference callouts:

	| :sample:`[N]` (where “N” is the order number of the corresponding reference)
	|
	| `Examples:`
	| :sample:`[1]`
	| :sample:`[1, 2]`
	| :sample:`[1–3]`
	| :sample:`[1, 3–4]`

	.. image:: /_static/callouts_format.png
		:alt: Callouts format
		:scale: 99%
	|
	- Check that only comma (,) and :ref:`en dash<en_dash>` (–) are used as a separators. No other separators are allowed. 

	- Check that there is a space after comma (,) and no space before and after en dash (–).

	- Check that all reference callouts are in :ref:`plain text<plain_text>` and a number (or numbers in case of ranges) is hyperlinked (callouts will not be hyperlinked if they appear in figures).

15.2. Check that callout number for each of the references is present in the text or is covered in the range of numbers. i.e. in the range of [1–3] reference 2 is not present in the text, but covered in the range. This case is acceptable. |br|
Callouts can be found in text, figures and tables.

15.3. Check that there are no callouts for non-existing references (i.e. there is a callout, but there is no reference).

15.4. Check that there are no references for which callouts are missing (i.e. there is a reference, but there is no callout for it).

15.5. Check that reference callouts appear in linear order throughout the manuscript. 1, 2, 3 and so on. Once a reference has initially been called out, it can be called out again in any order. For example, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4 is OK. Sometimes callouts can appear to be out of linear order due to being called out in tables - This is OK as long as all other callouts are following linear order.

	If one or more references or callouts are missing or are being called out of linear order in the text, please contact author.

.. _general_checks_html_research_papers:

16.6. General Checks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

16.6.1. Check for duplicates in the reference list. 

If you find duplicate references, please contact author and ask to correct the reference list along with renumbering reference call-outs.

16.6.2. Check for references translated into English from another language (usually you can spot those by keywords: translation, translated from, in Chinese, in French etc). Those references should comply to the following format:

   | :sample:`Author list. [Title of the article]. Journal Name. 1072; 1: 1-2.` (doi, if available) (PubMed link, if available)
   |
   | `Example:`
   | 34. Yang XM, Yang H. [Expression of high mobility group box-1 in the lung tissue and serum of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis]. Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi. 2013; 36:497-500.


16.6.3. Check for references containing journal title in English and original language (e.g. "International journal of cancer" and "Journal international du cancer"). Remove title in original language and leave English version. If there is just a "foreign language" version present, it is OK to leave that version (no need to find English one). Consult `PubMed <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/>`_/original article if in doubt of the correct journal name.

16.6.4. Check for extra information in the references (i.e. in addition to "standard" information). Remove all extra information.
   
   | `Example:`
   | ":official publication of the society of…"


16.6.5. Remove any instances of "Available from", “[Internet]”, "[pii]" Accessed dates (ex: “Accessed November 6, 2017.”) and empty (blank) doi.

16.6.6. Remove “PMID” and “PMCID” details, if present in any reference.

16.6.7. Check formatting for references that have been cited from supplemental issues. This information should appear in between the publishing year and semicolon in this format:

   | :sampleb:`(Suppl N)` (where “N” is the supplemental issue number)


	.. image:: /_static/suppl_issue_formatting.png
   	  	:alt: Supplemental issue formatting
   	  	:scale: 99%

16.6.8. Preprint articles are allowed in references. A couple of examples (not limited to) would be from sources such as `BioRxiv <https://www.biorxiv.org/>`_ and `Preprints <https://www.preprints.org/>`_.

- These should be formatted to the same standards as described above in :ref:`16.2<refs_author_list_html_research_papers>`, :ref:`16.3<reference_title_html_research_papers>` and :ref:`16.5<citation_data_other_journals_html_research_papers>` with the exception that a special ID number will typically be used in place of volume and page numbers.

16.6.9. Retracted articles are allowed in references. If you come across one, check to make sure that is has a retraction note:

- If an article is being cited that was later retracted, a note should appear at the end of the reference with the following details about the retraction notice (add a period before the note if one is not present): |br|
|span_format_start| Retraction in: JournalTitle. year; volume: pages. DOI [PubMed] |span_end|

.. image:: /_static/retracted_article.png
  	:alt: Retracted article note
  	:scale: 99%

- If a retraction notice itself is being cited, "Retracted:" should appear before the title of the paper like this: |br|
|span_format_start| Retracted: ReferenceTitle. JournalTitle. year; volume: pages. DOI [PubMed] |span_end|

.. image:: /_static/retraction_notice.png
  	:alt: Retraction notice note
  	:scale: 99%

If you come across a retracted reference that does not have a note to indicate retraction at all, contact the author to inform them that a retracted article is being cited and that we need to reformat it with the appropriate retraction note.

16.6.10. We prefer all non-journal article references to have a working link when possible. When links are missing, it is fine to search the internet and add if you are sure it is correct; however, it is not necessary to contact the author to provide missing links except where specifically noted to do so in these standards.

|
.. _websites_html_research_papers:

16.7. Websites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

16.7.1. There is no standard for website references. Authors are allowed to accompany a web link with any information they think appropriate. 

16.7.2. Check that website link is valid (i.e. it points to the referenced web resources, rather to error or other irrelevant page).

If the link is not valid, please contact author to provide a working link.

16.7.3. If a link is not present, search the internet and add it if you are sure it is correct. Otherwise leave as-is; it is not necessary to contact author to provide missing links.


|
.. _books_html_research_papers:

16.8. Books and Reports
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

16.8.1. There is no standard for books and reports. However at least Title and Year (and author name for book references) should be present.

16.8.2. If a link is not present, search the internet and add it (preferably a DOI) if you are sure it is correct. Otherwise leave as-is; it is not necessary to contact author to provide missing links.


16.9. Patents
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

16.9.1. Check on patent formatting with Christopher before sending corrections to production. Please see example of patent in picture below:

.. _supplementary_html_research_papers:

17. Supplementary Materials
---------------------------

17.1. Download File Names
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Supplementary materials, figures, tables, etc. are kept as separate downloads in HTML. When possible, a single file is used for each, but it is OK if tables and figures appear in separate files (regardless of size). |br|
Supplementary references should be kept in the file that they are being called out in. If they are being called out in more than one file, then they should be kept in their own file that’s named “:ref:`Supplementary References<suppl_refs_title_html_research_papers>`”.

.. image:: /_static/suppl_kept_separate_dl.png
  	:alt: Supplementary Materials are kept separate
  	:scale: 99%

Download file names should be descriptive of what is inside the file.

**17.1.1. Supplementary Figures**
